            <p>Being kind to others charges no money. It is a unique characteristic of showing love and caring for others selflessly. It is an act of making others happy without any specific reasons. This act helps in maintaining a long-lasting relationship based on honesty and loyalty. We were taught to be kind, be modest to everyone, take up various responsibilities, set our priorities, and make decisions when we were kids. Being kind is a sense of honesty, purity, loyalty, happiness, and integrity. Since we live in a society and share various relationships, we must make sure that our behaviour and actions do not harm others.</p>
